This is an Image Processing Project that allows you to do certain operations on the image you want to detect edges in that image
The operation are:
  -  Calculatig its threshold.
  -  Simple Halftoning.
  -  Advanced Halftoning using Error Diffusion.
  -  Apply Histogram.
  -  Histogram Equalization.
  -  Simple Edge Detection Methods:
     - Sobel Operator.
     - Prewitt Operator.
     - Kirsch Compass Masks.
  -  Advanced Edge Detection Methods:
     - Homogeneity Operator.
     - Difference Operator.
     - Difference of Gaussians Operator.
     - Contrast-Based Edge Detection.
     - Variance Edge Detection.
     - Range Edge Detection.
  -  Three Types of Filterings:
     - High-Pass Filter.
     - Low-Pass Filter.
     - Median Filter.
  -  Image Operations:
     - Invert The Image.
     - Adding Two Images.
     - Subtracting Two Images.
  -  Histogram-Based Segmentaion:
     - Manual Technique.
     - Histogram Peak Technique.
     - Histogram Valley Technique.
     - Adaptive Histogram Technique.
